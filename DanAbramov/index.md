##### Hi,

#### Thank you so much for volunteering to read the draft of my course, Just JavaScript.

##### Right now the course is a sequence of mails that I will be drafting and sending to you over the next several months.

##### There's no charge, but I would like to ask that you respond with any feedback or questions that you might have.

##### This is a rough draft and I'm not spending too much time and care editing and polishing the manuscript.

##### You'll receive the full sequence of emails for this draft, a module at a time starting tomorrow with Mental Models. The rest of the modules will follow.

##### It's a raw and relatively unfiltered tour of my understanding of JavaScript and the mental models involved with writing computer programs in JavaScript.

##### Along the way, I've been collaborating with Maggie Appleton, so you can expect some fun and interesting visuals to accompany the manuscripts!

##### Please note that this course assumes you have some experience with JavaScript and isn't intended for the complete novice.

### I hope you enjoy it.

### Cheers,

### Dan
