Meet Sherlock Holmes, a world-renowned detective from London:

```javascript
let sherlock = {
  surname: "Holmes",
  address: { city: "London" },
};
```

His friend John Watson has recently moved in to live with Sherlock:

```javascript
let john = {
  surname: "Watson",
  address: sherlock.address,
};
```

Sherlock is a brilliant detective but a difficult flatmate. One day, John decides he’s had enough. John changes his surname and moves to live in Malibu:

```javascript
john.surname = "Lennon";
john.address.city = "Malibu";
```

Time for a small exercise. Write down your answers to these questions:

```javascript
console.log(sherlock.surname); // ?
console.log(sherlock.address.city); // ?
console.log(john.surname); // ?
console.log(john.address.city); // ?
```

Before you scroll back up to re-read the code, I want you to approach it in a particular way. Open a [sketch app](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/0vuqpzd390cgudddnnhp/l2heh6uzz7g7zgf6/aHR0cHM6Ly9leGNhbGlkcmF3LmNvbS8=) or get paper and pen, and <strong>sketch out your mental model of what happens on every line.</strong> It’s okay if you’re not sure how to represent it. We haven’t yet discussed these topics so use your best guess.

Then, with the help of your final sketch, answer the four questions above.

Now let’s check your answers:

```javascript
console.log(sherlock.surname); // "Holmes"
console.log(sherlock.address.city); // "Malibu"
console.log(john.surname); // "Lennon"
console.log(john.address.city); // "Malibu"
```

This is not a typo — they are indeed <strong>both in Malibu</strong>. It’s not so easy to get away from Sherlock! With a wrong mental model, one might conclude that sherlock.address.city is "London" — but it’s not.

To see why, we need to learn how properties work in our JavaScript universe.

# Properties

We’ve talked about objects before. For example, here is a sherlock variable pointing to an object value. We create a new object value by writing {}:

```javascript
let sherlock = {};
```

In our universe, it might look like this:

<img src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/44nZlHk28aiOu_WExArVgWwVQM-9udClfSRqdRWgVr-wA3n8hsAP_-Vk2gJ0CX1PcIDGyTfWtUIGOrGQNb2F6juSEaj2e5lPaKl1PDCmzZSwaVjGJxrk05RnDvmSTjy7p1nVh5mhSkOSe_vk30bwpvf3EB4jBAynPxvRimbEMUI83glpaA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1584416479/just-javascript-email-images/jj07/sherlock_empty.png">

However, objects are primarily useful to group related data together. For example, we might want to group different things we know about Sherlock:

```javascript
let sherlock = {
  surname: "Holmes",
  age: 64,
};
```

Here, sherlock is still a variable, but surname and age are not. They are properties. Unlike variables, properties belong to a particular object.

<strong>In our JavaScript universe, both variables and properties act like “wires”.</strong> However, the wires of properties start from objects rather than from our code:

<img src="https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ZkzOUSpivqn9vUXaOBMffHyNyBZgyQ4WY7c7rPQWGMCbSKg3cHGTudkvEMyCvAjiTPyxC5zijEgoS9HqTt65OljhBaJKeijoxzOhXkV8Wdh-htVOLDHPx0fPc8t48wvkZb0cLCPLi-2McsLr55kUj2RRUveUKIns3gY7vk4FXVVH-vG1vw=s0-d-e1-ft#https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1584416479/just-javascript-email-images/jj07/sherlock_props.png">

Here, we can see that the sherlock <strong>variable</strong> points to an object we have created. That object has two <strong>properties</strong>. Its surname property points to the "Holmes" string value, and its age property points to the 64 number value.

Importantly, properties don’t contain values — they point at them! It turns out that our universe is full of wires. Some of them start in our code (variables), and others start from objects (properties). All wires always point at values.

Before reading this, you might have imagined that values live “inside” objects because they appear “inside” in code. This intuition often leads to mistakes, so we will be “thinking in wires” instead. Take one more look at the code and the diagram. Make sure you’re comfortable with them before you continue.

# Reading a Property

We can read a property’s current value by using the “dot notation”:

```javascript
console.log(sherlock.age); // 64
```

Here, sherlock.age is our old friend — an expression, a question to the JavaScript universe. To answer it, JavaScript first follows the sherlock wire:

<img src="https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/8GVcnjJ5C7oqcExGIXhH8QAFVQo-h-s2frl_Y0o9bEGyLKFWuLgTjB6TCElKL9uLoO8hkdVQXcv_hPpFQiQk-VLiQd7eiSns82I2RXBqLljwvlj9W36b4xx0rSsfl1nodRsc90vgDbKDOK5MK0EuBPdlxPdbAqFT1gx4Bv_6ie2wjUqQPH0F=s0-d-e1-ft#https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1584416479/just-javascript-email-images/jj07/sherlock_readage.gif">

It leads to an object. From that object, JavaScript follows the age property.

Our object’s age property points to 64, so sherlock.age results in 64.

# Property Names

Properties have names. A single object can’t have two properties with the same name. For example, our object can’t have two properties called age

The property names are always case-sensitive! For example, age and Age would be two completely different properties from JavaScript’s point of view.

If we don’t know a property name ahead of time but we have it in code as a string value, we can use the [] “bracket notation” to read it from an object:

```javascript
let sherlock = { surname: "Holmes", age: 64 };
let propertyName = prompt("What do you want to know?");
alert(sherlock[propertyName]); // Read property by its name
```

Try this code in your browser console and enter age when prompted.

# Assigning to a Property

What happens when we assign a value to a property?

```javascript
sherlock.age = 65;
```

Let’s split this code into the left and the right side, separated by =.

### First, we figure out which wire is on the left side: sherlock.age.

We follow the sherlock wire, and then pick the age property wire:

<img src="https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/2ozJpC72LMy6fwAa6omMIF6Yj8upJ3thCmfOxDFJE-LqTBhIFIwO9Z5005_v6gKb1FvzhcyhU83QbxL8BT3MA4e7FYrsZCS3E5dMKXafBpVwQtq-fsuc2eHpC_Gbq4ALgM6-i56TAkVXnYTkO2FHIacPUEYmHCJm6lWVOe8txMs8hY26nhTFFnT6Ix5IMg=s0-d-e1-ft#https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1584416479/just-javascript-email-images/jj07/sherlock_reassign_age-1.gif">

Note that we don’t follow the age wire to 64. We don’t care what its current value is. On the left side of the assignment, we are looking for <strong>the wire itself</strong>.

Remember which wire we picked? Carry on.

Next, we figure out which value is on the right side: 65.

Unlike the left side, the right side of an assignment always expresses a value. In this example, the right side’s value is the number value 65. Let’s summon it:

<src img="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/u1-6f0N8LN5tGXX2LQU2etKehbCUFplROCqpi9INJvNGuNZTl25Fdqe1rXM0hIKISSmP4epzRpt4YHzUuahO-0DxlrH7gv0L6B9uYKonctf0RW42InO50jkg6fD-0j6jwfBVTmpkffTQlTUEyg3IRBtyYX9WhRvwyKkpFfg67n4PtK8X0crxCngcUNonOQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1584416480/just-javascript-email-images/jj07/sherlock_reassign_age-2.gif">

Now we are ready to perform the assignment.

### At last, we point the wire on the left side to the value on the right side:

<img src="https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/P4TXLPcSCXKDFEodEpKkiCt-grLi_fcQ50UzTttL5BR_qZrWYSKzgEwbNrxGO7htvlQFslhxCqgQGJC8Z--_PNkTAymfBnCYnpOzPiLqDv7npqhjyY-XDQGtvi0NJ_uHinKZzHlp3dNzW3QvoCQzkfqgTsBmCUbLiILOFZMCwnN7spdj-nASdWalMasSgw=s0-d-e1-ft#https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1584416479/just-javascript-email-images/jj07/sherlock_reassign_age-3.gif">

And we’re done! From now on, reading sherlock.age would give us 65.

# Missing Properties

You might wonder what happens if we read a property that doesn't exist:

```javascript
let sherlock = { surname: "Holmes", age: 64 };
console.log(sherlock.boat); // ?
```

We know that sherlock.boat is a property expression. The JavaScript universe follows certain rules to decide which value to “answer” us with.

### These rules look roughly like this:

1. Figure out the value of the part before the dot (.).
2. If that value is null or undefined, throw an error immediately.
3. Check whether a property with that name exists in our object.
   a. If it exists, answer with the value this property points to.
   b. If it doesn’t exist, answer with the undefined value.

Note these rules are a bit simplified, and we will need to amend them in the future modules. Still, they already tell us a lot about how JavaScript works!

For example, sherlock points to an object that doesn’t have a boat property. So sherlock.boat gives us undefined as an answer:

```javascript
let sherlock = { surname: "Holmes", age: 64 };
console.log(sherlock.boat); // undefined
```

Note <strong>this does not mean</strong> that our object has a boat property pointing to undefined! It only has two properties, and neither of them is called boat:

<img src="https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ZkzOUSpivqn9vUXaOBMffHyNyBZgyQ4WY7c7rPQWGMCbSKg3cHGTudkvEMyCvAjiTPyxC5zijEgoS9HqTt65OljhBaJKeijoxzOhXkV8Wdh-htVOLDHPx0fPc8t48wvkZb0cLCPLi-2McsLr55kUj2RRUveUKIns3gY7vk4FXVVH-vG1vw=s0-d-e1-ft#https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1584416479/just-javascript-email-images/jj07/sherlock_props.png">

It is tempting to think sherlock.boat directly corresponds to the concept of a property in our mental model, but <strong>that’s not quite correct</strong>. It is a question to the JavaScript engine — and so the engine follows the rules to answer it.

It looks at the object that sherlock points to, sees that it <strong>doesn’t</strong> have a boat property, and gives us back the undefined value because <strong>that’s what the rules say</strong>. There is no deeper reason to this: computers follow the rules.

Scroll up and re-read the rules again. Can you apply them in practice?

```javascript
let sherlock = { surname: "Holmes", age: 64 };
console.log(sherlock.boat.name); // ?
```

What happens if we run this code? <strong>Don’t guess — follow the rules.</strong>

Hint: there are two dots, so you need to follow the rules two times.

The answer is that calculating sherlock.boat.name throws an error:

- We need to first figure out the value of sherlock.boat.
  - To do that, we need to figure out the value of sherlock.
    - The wire from sherlock variable leads to an object.
    - Therefore, the value of sherlock is that object.
  - An object is not null or undefined, so we keep going.
  - That object does not have a boat property.
  - Therefore, the value of sherlock.boat is undefined.

* We’ve got undefined on the left side of the dot (.).
* The rules say that null or undefined on the left side is an error.

```javascript
let sherlock = { surname: "Holmes", age: 64 };
console.log(sherlock.boat); // undefined
console.log(sherlock.boat.name); // TypeError!
```

If this still seems confusing, scroll up and mechanically follow the rules.

# Recap

- Properties are wires — a bit like variables. They both point at values. Unlike variables, properties <strong>start from objects</strong> in our universe
- Properties have names. Properties belong to particular objects. You can’t have more than one property with the same name on an object.

* Generally, you can perform an assignment in three steps

  1. Figure out which wire is on the left.
  2. Figure out which value is on the right
  3. Point that wire to that value.

* An expression like obj.property is calculated in three steps
  1. Figure out which value is on the left.
  2. If it’s null or undefined, throw an error.
  3. If that property exists, the result is the value its wire points to.
  4. If that property doesn’t exist, the result is undefined.

Note that this mental model of properties is still a bit simplified. It is good enough for the next few modules, but we will need to expand it in the future.

If you got confused by the Sherlock Holmes example in the beginning, you can optionally get back to it and try to follow it with our new mental model. The next module will include a detailed walkthrough of it in case you’re still not quite sure why it works this way. Try to get used to seeing properties as wires.
